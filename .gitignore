# ML Models: As per the plan, models are BUNDLED in app assets (res/, Resources/).
# Therefore, they ARE part of the source code and should NOT be ignored here.

# Runtime Databases (Room/CoreData): These database files are generated by the OS on the device
# and are not part of the repository structure. They are handled by the app's runtime environment.
